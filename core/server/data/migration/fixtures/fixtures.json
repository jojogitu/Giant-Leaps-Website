                    "markdown": "You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!\n\n> Ghost - Just a blogging platform\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)",

Johnny-Five programs can be written for Arduino (all models), Electric Imp, Beagle Bone, Intel Galileo & Edison, Linino One, Pinoccio, pcDuino3, Raspberry Pi, Particle/Spark Core & Photon, Tessel 2, TI Launchpad and more!**\n\nJohnny-Five has grown from a passion project into a tool for inspiring learning and creativity for people of all ages, backgrounds, and from all across the world.\n\nJust interested in learning and building awesome things? You might want to start with the official [Johnny-Five website](http://johnny-five.io). The website combines content from this repo, the wiki, tutorials from the Bocoup blog and several third-party websites into a single, easily-discoverable source:\n\n* If you want to find the API documentation, [that’s right here](http://johnny-five.io/api/).\n* Need to figure out what platform to use for a project? We put that stuff [here](http://johnny-five.io/platform-support/).\n* Need inspiration for your next NodeBot? Check out the [examples](http://johnny-five.io/examples/).\n* Want to stay up-to-date with projects in the community? [Check this out](http://johnny-five.io/articles/).\n* Need NodeBots community or Johnny-Five project updates and announcements? [This](http://johnny-five.io/news/) is what you’re looking for.\n\n\nJohnny-Five does not attempt to provide \"all the things\", but instead focuses on delivering robust, reality tested, highly composable APIs that behave consistently across all supported hardware platforms. Johnny-Five wants to be a baseline control kit for hardware projects, allowing you the freedom to build, grow and experiment with diverse JavaScript libraries of your own choice. Johnny-Five couples comfortably with:\n\n- Popular application libraries such as [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).\n- Fellow hardware projects like [ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone), [Aerogel](https://github.com/ceejbot/aerogel) and [Spheron](https://github.com/alchemycs/spheron)\n- Bluetooth game controllers like [XBox Controller](https://github.com/andrew/node-xbox-controller) and [DualShock](https://github.com/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller)\n- IoT frameworks, such as [Octoblu](http://www.octoblu.com/)\n\n...And that's only a few of the many explorable possibilities.

The following code demonstrates how this is done using the Johnny-Five framework.\n\n```javascript\nvar five = require(\"johnny-five\");\nvar board = new five.Board();\n\nboard.on(\"ready\", function() {\n  // Create an Led on pin 13\n  var led = new five.Led(13);\n  // Blink every half second\n  led.blink(500);\n});\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/raw/master/assets/led-blink.gif\">\n\n> Note: Node will crash if you try to run johnny-five in the node REPL, but board instances will create their own contextual REPL. Put your script in a file.\n\n\n## Supported Hardware\n\nJohnny-Five has been tested on a variety of Arduino-compatible [Boards](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Board).\n\nFor non-Arduino based projects, a number of platform-specific [IO Plugins](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/IO-Plugins) are available. IO Plugins allow Johnny-Five code to communicate with any non-Arduino based hardware in whatever language that platforms speaks!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for the Johnny-Five API can be found [here](http://johnny-five.io/api/) and [example programs here](http://johnny-five.io/examples/).\n\n## Guidance\n\nNeed help? Ask a question on the [NodeBots Community Forum](http://forums.nodebots.io). If you just have a quick question or are interested in ongoing design discussions, join us in the [Johnny-Five Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/rwaldron/johnny-five).\n\nFor step-by-step examples, including an electronics primer, check out [Arduino Experimenter's Guide for NodeJS](http://node-ardx.org/) by [@AnnaGerber](https://twitter.com/AnnaGerber)\n\nHere is a list of [prerequisites](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started#prerequisites) for Linux, OSX or Windows.\n\nCheck out the [bluetooth guide](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/JY-MCU-Bluetooth-Serial-Port-Module-Notes) if you want to remotely control your robot.\n\n## Setup and Assemble Arduino\n\n- Recommended Starting Kit: [Sparkfun Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001)\n- Download [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)\n- Plug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB\n- Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmataPlus\n    + StandardFirmataPlus is available in Firmata v2.5.0 or greater\n- Click the \"Upload\" button.\n\nIf the upload was successful, the board is now prepared and you can close the Arduino IDE.\n\nFor non-Arduino projects, each IO Plugin's repo will provide its own platform specific setup instructions.\n\n\n## Hey you, here's Johnny!\n\n#### Source Code:\n\n``` bash\ngit clone git://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five.git && cd johnny-five\n\nnpm install\n```\n\n#### npm package:\n\nInstall the module with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install johnny-five\n```\n\n\n## Example Programs\n\nTo get you up and running quickly, we provide a variety of examples for using each Johnny-Five component. One thing we’re especially excited about is the extensive collection of [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) diagrams you’ll find throughout the site. A huge part of doing any Johnny-Five project is handling the actual hardware, and we’ve included these as part of the documentation because we realised that instructions on how to write code to control a servo are insufficient without instructions on how to connect a servo!\n\nTo interactively navigate the examples, visit the [Johnny-Five examples](http://johnny-five.io/examples/) page on the official website.
